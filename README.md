# Shop-Management-System-UI

I have developed a console-based application using C# that offers various functionalities such as adding, deleting, and editing products. The application provides an intuitive interface for managing projects, editing product details, and enables efficient sorting of products based on their prices. Additionally, it facilitates effective order and stock management for the shop, allowing users to keep track of inventory and handle customer orders seamlessly.

Moreover, the application features a dedicated customer module that allows customers to provide reviews about the products they have purchased. This valuable feedback helps in assessing the quality and satisfaction level of customers, enabling continuous improvement in the product offerings.

With a user-friendly interface and robust functionality, this application provides a professional solution for businesses to streamline their operations, enhance customer experience, and make informed decisions based on customer reviews.
